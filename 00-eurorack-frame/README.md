# Hog Moduleur / Eurorack Frame

Extensible, 3D printable enclosure/frame designed for synth development in Eurorack format. 

## Components

1. **Rail** — designed to be parametric, meaning that you can print it in any length just by adjusting the Y dimension in the 3D slicer software. It accepts standard M3 square nuts and M3x8 bolts.
2. **Connector** — join the stands to the rails vertically, and they also link rails to each other horizontally.
3. **Stands** — slanted at a 10° angle. Since they are not permanently coupled with the rails, it's easy to design and swap in other stand styles (e.g. flat) if needed.

## Assembly

No extra hardware is needed for full assembly.

1. Slide connectors to upper and lower slots of first stand
2. Slide in rails to first stand
3. Connect second stand and rails with connectors

Default width of the rails is 24HP but it can be set directly in the slicer. Once we need more space it'll be very easy to extend the system to 48HP and further, just by offsetting the connectors and attaching new rails and stands.

## Printing instructions

When printing any of these components, choose the sides as the base in your slicer app. This allows printing without support which results in a much cleaner and stronger print, plus you can change the width (height) of the components as you wish, directly in the slicer.

## Mounting Eurorack modules

The rails welcome standard M3 square nuts and you can use M3x8 screws to mount max 2mm thick panels. Use M3x10 screws for thicker panels.
