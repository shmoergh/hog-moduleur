# Hog Moduleur / Sidechain Mixer

4 channel Eurorack compatible mixer and sidechain compressor.

## Features

- Gain control for channel 4 which allows to amplify line level signals to Eurorack level, allowing to mix external instruments with Eurorack sound sources
- Dedicated output volume control
- Separate core and UI PCBs for reusability and custom UI builds
- Gerber files for JLCPCB order
- Designed from very common electronic components
