# Basic documentation

Write basic documentation of how to set up the Brain project for development

## Todos

At a minimum the docs should contain:

- [x] What is the Brain module
- [x] Basic folder structure
- [x] Prerequisites: XCode, VSCode, Homebrew, CMake, GNU ARM embedded toolchain, OpenOCD and Minicom (optional)
- [x] The `pico-sdk` folder is installed as a submodule so the git command for that
- [x] How to create a new program (using the script)
- [x] How to debug a program (changing the launch.json executable)
