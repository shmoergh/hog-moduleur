# Shmøergh Hog Moduleur PSU – ±12V Eurorack Power Supply

This is the power supply unit for the Hog Moduleur, but it can be used in any Eurorack setup.

## 🐷 Features

- ±12V power. Works with any of the following Mean Well regulators:
    - NSD10-12D12
    - DKM10A-12
    - DKMW20F-12
    - DKMW30F-12
- Requires **center positive** 12V DC input
- Breakable board: PSU and connector section can be separated (cut) for flexible mounting
- Built in DC barrel jack input and power switch
- Optional +/- input headers for off-board DC & switch placement. Just make sure you know what you're doing if you're using it.
- Designed for small Eurorack cases and standalone synth builds. Output current depends on the regulator used (see above).
- Open source hardware

## 🛠️ How to Build

- Gerber files for JLCPCB ordering are in the [`production`](./production) folder
- BOM is also in the [`production`](./production) folder. All components are available at Mouser
- Use the KiCad schematic and PCB layout for soldering reference
- **Before connecting any modules**, always measure the output voltages to confirm ±12V is stable

⚠️ This is a DIY-friendly project but assumes you know how to solder, read schematics, and handle basic electronics safely.
